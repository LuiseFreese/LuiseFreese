Contribute to Community Docs and make tech understandable

### Microsoft 365 PnP
Breaking news: Everything is awesome, because I am part of the #M365PnP team 🎶- I am leading an initiative to close the gap between makers and developers and to help engage with every developer working with Power Platform. Find awesome articles and discussion in the [Microsoft 365 PnP Community on Techcommunity](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-pnp-blog/bg-p/Microsoft365PnPBlog). I own the [M365PnP Power Platform Samples](https://github.com/pnp/powerplatform-samples) repo and love to see your samples soon there!
