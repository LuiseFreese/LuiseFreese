# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I am Luise!

I work as an independent M365 Consultant based in Germany, but traveling the world. At least, this is what I said to introduce myself in the pre-Covid19 world. Now I am at home and talk 8 hours straight into my monitor. After that, I start working ðŸ¤£ besides that, together with Elio Struyf, I run https://pyod.shop ,a sticker store

I love all things community, Power Platform and #MicrosoftGraph! You can find me 24/7 on twitter :-) Not enough? I created those labels here because all the kool kids have those:

## Whats important to me & what's going on?

### #SharingIsCaring
Learning right now how to contribute to Community Docs and how to use GitHub ðŸ™ˆ and I am blessed to have ongoing support! 

### Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging

Diversity is more than just more women in tech (although this would already be a good start). To me, it's a holistic approach to include and welcome everyone.
