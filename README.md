# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I am Luise!

I work as an independent M365 Consultant based in Germany, but traveling the world. At least, this is what I said to introduce myself in the pre-Covid19 world. Now I am at home and talk 8 hours straight into my monitor. After that, I start working ðŸ¤£ . You will find my blog at https://m365princess.com, and you can find me nearly 24/7 on twitter :-) 

Besides that, together with Elio Struyf, I run https://pyod.shop - a sticker store. I am awarded as a  Microsoft MVP Office Apps & Services and probably the only Satya-endorsed sketchnote artist in the community ðŸ˜‡

I love all things community, Power Platform and #MicrosoftGraph!  Not enough? I created those labels here because all the kool kids have those:

## Whats important to me & what's going on?

### #SharingIsCaring
Contribute to Community Docs and make tech understandable

###
Breaking news: Everything is awesome, because I am part of the #PnP team - leading an initiative to close the gap between makers and developers and to help engage with every developer working with Power Platform. 

### Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging

Diversity is more than just more women in tech (although this would already be a good start). To me, it's a holistic approach to include and welcome everyone. 

### Build more stuff

using Azure Services, Microsoft Graph, Power Platform  ðŸš€
