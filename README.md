## Whats important to me & what's going on?

### Microsoft 365 Community Docs
I actively contribute to the Microsoft 365 Community Docs and make tech more understandable 

### Microsoft 365 PnP

Breaking news: Everything is awesome, because I am part of the #M365PnP team 🎶- I am leading an initiative to close the gap between makers and developers and to help engage with every developer working with Power Platform. Find awesome articles and discussion in the [Microsoft 365 PnP Community on Techcommunity](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-pnp-blog/bg-p/Microsoft365PnPBlog). If you like to contribute, [please finde guidance here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-pnp-blog/what-is-the-microsoft-365-pnp-community/ba-p/2119096). 

I own the [M365PnP Power Platform Samples](https://github.com/pnp/powerplatform-samples) repo and love to see your samples soon there! 

I also joined the PnP [Sharing Is Caring](https://pnp.github.io/sharing-is-caring/) team as a maintainer, where I help new contributors getting started contributing. 

### Build more stuff

using Azure Services, Microsoft Graph, Power Platform  🚀 I love to try ou new things, share my experiences and provide feedback. Currently I am working on 'The baby', my first open-source solution and a cool app using Azure Custom Vision in Logic Apps. Can't wait to tell and show more in the future!
